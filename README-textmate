To get ultra fast CMD-R results in textmate you need to patch the run_script.rb that comes with textmate:

cd /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Bundles/Ruby.tmbundle/Support/RubyMate/

patch -p0 < wherever_snailgun_was_installed/textmate.patch

To run test in never before seen speed simply cd into your rails-app (tested with rails 3) and say:

> snailgun

the output should read something like:
Now entering subshell for RAILS_ENV=test. Use 'exit' to terminate snailgun
Server starting for RAILS_ENV=test
.. some seconds later ...
Server ready for RAILS_ENV=test

Now you can either use fruby instead of ruby to start tests "by hand":

fruby -Itest test/unit/your_test.rb

or - in TextMate - simply navigate to your_test.rb and hit CMD-R

enjoy!
