If you use ruby-1.9.2-p0 on Snow Leopard snailgun won't work out of the Box!

I have included a small patch to the ruby-sources that make it work:

(this is assuming you use rvm)

cd $HOME/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p0/ext/socket
patch -p1 < wherever_snailgun_was_installed/ruby-1.9.2-p0.patch
ruby extconf.rb
make clean
make clean install

Patch was taken from http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/repositories/revision/ruby-19?rev=29242
